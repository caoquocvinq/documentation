# \*\*Spike Plan

==============

**Name:** Cao Quoc Vi

## Context

In order to help students who uses Windows Operating System to successfully deploy OnTrack on their local machines. This Spike determines the technical solution for using WSL2 to support deploying OnTrack.

**Knowledge Gap: New comers will not have the fully understanding of how WSL2 works in order to deploy OnTrack using their Windows laptop. Additionally, OnTrack is a fully-developed application which is less comprehensive when a fresher joins in and starts doing all the work since there are knowledge gap not only in programming languages (Ruby on Rails) but also the structure of the system.**

**Skill Gap: New Junior have less the experience working as a team with the use of the professional method such as Agile and it will be difficult to allocate task and also takes time for them to learn new things.**

**Technology Gap:**

- The team might be not familiar with some of the Programming language used to build OnTrack.
- Some of the new applications such as Docker that they must get used to before actually doing contributions.
- GitHub is suprisingly not well-known among the Juniors as well as the basic command lines. 
- WSL2 is essential in this project because Windows machines should be needing this to run the Linux commands.

## Goals/Deliverables

What are the goals and deliverables of this spike? Example:

- Test out how can we install WSL2 on Windows as well as Ubuntu.
- Gather all the requirements for running OnTrack.
- Structure a step-by-step guide to deploy OnTrack.

**Planned start date:** Example: Week 7 T2 2023

**Deadline:** Week 9 T2 2023

## Planning notes

- Learn how to install WSL2 and Ubuntu on local Windows Machines.
- Install and Set up Docker.
- Running Dev Container on Visual Studio Code to deploy.
- Fix bugs along the ways
- Structure a perfect guide with steps for Juniors to follow.
- Test on another Windows machines.
